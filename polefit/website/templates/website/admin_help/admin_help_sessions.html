                    <p>From the Dashboard, follow the link to "Sessions".  This will show you a list of all the sessions that
                    have been scheduled, both past and present.  Note that only sessions for the current week onwards will
                    be displayed on the website on the timetable pages.</p>

                    <p>To edit an individual session, click on the name in blue in the Session Type column.</p>

                    <p>Sessions can be filtered by various fields.  Use the filter drop down list at the right hand side.
                    One of the most useful filters will be to show just the sessions for this week or next week.  Under
                    "Session Dates", select "This week".  You can choose to filter on more than one field.</p>

                    <h4>Duplicating classes</h4>

                    <p>One of your most frequent Admin tasks will be to enter all the classes scheduled for the next week.
                    To make this easier, there is an option to duplicate sessions for one week later.  To duplicate all
                    of this week's classes for next week, first filter by "This week".  Now, use the check boxes to select all the
                    classes for this week (use the topmost checkbox in the "session type" column header to select all at once.</p>

                    <p>Go to the drop down menu at the bottom of the page, and choose "Duplicate for next week"</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="{% static "website/images/admin_help/sessions duplicate dropdown.png" %}"><br>

                    <p>You will be taken to a confirm page which displays the class dates/times that you've selected, and
                    the class dates/times that are about to be created.  If this is OK, click Confirm and these classes
                    will be created.</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="{% static "website/images/admin_help/duplicate confirm page.png" %}"><br>

                    <h4>Adding a single new class/workshop</h4>
                    <p>To add an individual class, use the Add Session button on the summary page.  You will be taken to
                    a form to complete for the new session.  Note that this can be a regular class, a one-off workshop,
                    or any other session that you want to appear on the timetable pages of the website.</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="{% static "website/images/admin_help/add session.png" %}"><br>

                    <p>Use the drop down lists to select a Session Type, Instructor and Venue.  The + buttons can be used
                    add a new Session Type, Instructor or Venue if necessary.  Note that by default, the level is entered
                    as "All levels"; this can be changed to anything you want. </p>

                    <p>Also by default, "Show instructor" is NOT ticked; the instructor will be displayed on the Admin
                    pages (and you can filter sessions by instructor), but the timetable will not display who the instructor
                    is for this session.  You may want to change this occasionally, for example if you are hosting a workshop
                    (e.g. Pantera's workshops) and want the instructor's name to be shown.</p>

                    <p>"Spaces available" is ticked by default.  If a class is fully booked, you will need to go into this
                        session and untick this box.  On the timetable pages, a class is shown in green if it has spaces available,
                    and in red if it is either booked, or for a past date.</p>
