            <p>Workshops are only displayed on the site if the "show on site" checkbox has been ticked.</p>
            <p>Payments are via paypal; you can enter any paypal email address here, but make sure you've
            checked it carefully.  Use the "Test paypal email" link to confirm that the site can
            process payments to the email address you've chosen.</p>

            <h2>Bookings</h2>
            <p>Review online bookings and waiting lists for workshops.</p>

            <h2>Payments</h2>
            <p>Paypal transaction information.</p>
            <p><strong>Test Paypal Email:</strong> Use this to check a new paypal email before making a
            workshop available for booking.  This sends a payment of Â£0.01 to the paypal account
            associated with the email you are testing.  You must use a different account to the one being
            tested to to send the payment.  Paypal accounts do not need to be business accounts, but they
            must be verified.</p>

            <h2>Activity Log</h2>
            <p>Tracks activity on the site, particularly in relation to bookings.</p>
