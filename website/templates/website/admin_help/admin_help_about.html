                    <p>The About Page Admin section lets you change the content on the About Us page.  There are two
                        sections that you can select from the Admin Dashboard, "About page information" and "Past events":
                    </p>

                    <h4>About page information</h4>

                    <p>This populates the text description on the About Us page.  Currently there is one section, however
                        you are able to enter more sections, with optional heading and subheadings, if you want to.</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="{% static "website/images/admin_help/about page change screen.png" %}"><br>

                    <p>Note that line breaks between paragraphs are not displayed on the summary page, however if you click
                        on a section, you will see them in the description field.</p>

                        <img class="img-responsive" src="{% static "website/images/admin_help/about page edit.png" %}"><br>
                    <p>The current text consists of a
                        main heading and a few paragraphs of text.  If you want to have another section heading, add a new
                        section and give it a heading and/or subheading as you want.  It's best to make changes, save, and
                        then check the webpage itself to make sure the text is showing up the way you want it to.</p>

                    <h4>Past Events</h4>

                    <p>This populates the list of events and acheivements by Startlet students and instructors.  They are
                        organised by event, and display on the website in the reverse order that they are entered in the Admin
                    page (it assumes that the last event you entered on the Admin page was the most recent).</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="{% static "website/images/admin_help/about past events change screen.png" %}"><br>

                    <p>To edit an event, click on its name.  To add another event, use the Add Past Event button.  Below
                    is an example of adding the Starlet Showcase 2014 to the list of past events.  The description and
                        placing fields are optional.  If nothing is entered here (or if all specific acheivements are
                        unticked (so not to be displayed), the event name only will be shown on the About Us page.  These
                        fields do not need to be only used for competition categories and placings, you can use them to display
                        any descriptive text you want.
