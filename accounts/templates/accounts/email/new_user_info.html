<strong>How to prepare for a Sunshine pole class</strong>

<strong>What's best to wear?</strong>

<ul>
    <li>Bare skin is what allows you to grip the pole, so we recommend fitted shorts and a vest top. (There are alternative options if you do not wish to wear shorts.) Make sure you have something warm to wear until you warm up.</li>
    <li>Class can be done in socks, barefoot or indoor trainers.</li>
    <li>Strictly no jewellery, we recommend leaving all jewellery at home to keep it safe.</li>
</ul>

<strong>What to bring?</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Water bottle.</li>
    <li>Small hand towel/cloth for wiping the pole.</li>
    <li>Kneepads for attending "Poledance" classes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Memberships are due on the 1st day of the month.</li>
